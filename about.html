                        <p class="animated bounceInRight">Hi,
                            I have been a photographer for 10 years photographing weddings for about 5 years in the Toronto area. It has always been my goal to capture the best of everyone at the right moment. I also have a degree in Graphics Design and have worked for several years as a pre-press operator.  
                        </p>
                        <p class="animated bounceInRight">
                            My style of photography is more journalistic rather than posed. I believe that in order to capture people at their best is usually when they don't know they are being photographed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="animated bounceInRight">To add to my Photography and Design experience I have also completed a Web Development bootcamp course at University of Toronto. Learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node JS, AJAX, MySQL, Mongo DB, and GitBash with introductions into REACT and C#.</p>
                        <p class="animated bounceInRight">Although I may have experience in all of these fields my learning and hasn't stopped. Each of these fields have new challenges that I have not experienced before and so I never stop learning.</p>
